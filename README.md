Quickcheck is the little brother to [Statcheck](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/statcheck)
although it operates under the same principles.

Statcheck is quite complicated to set up, not the least because most of the
demos in Compet-N are for the copyrighted Doom IWADs which cannot be freely
distributed. Instead, Quickcheck makes use of a selected set of fan-made PWAD
files and D2ALL long-form demos from the
[Doomed Speed Demos Archive](http://doomedsda.us/). These can be run through
in a matter of minutes to gain some basic confidence that a source port's
behavior is continuing to match Vanilla Doom.
